# proteinExprML
Protein Expression in Mice with Down Syndrome: a Jupyter notebook in Python. Final project for the Machine Learning course. 

The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications. Eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype, behavior and 
treatment. The goal is to classify mice into 8 different classes, based on protein expression, using techniques studied during the course such as:
 - clustering: hierarchical, k-means, DBscan;  
 - classification: logistic regression, LDA, QDA, SVM, KNN and more;  
 - linear regression: OLS, ridge, lasso, k-nearest regression.  
 
 The notebook features an exploratory analysis and tests different algorithms, using the `seaborn` library for meaningful representations.
